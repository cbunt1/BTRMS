write_to_stderr

Branch scope: Change output behavior of all three scripts to write user info to
    stdout, and all error messages to stderr.
    
Push this to the Develop branch and start a new branch to combine the file
    efficiency update.
    
    -- Works on TempFile-02...(Discard parameters phase 1)
    
    
TempFile-04 - final network parameters
TempFile-05 - Final all-other parameters

The two combine to make the final script.
Dumping the two-phase crap will reduce by one file the writes to the flashfs
    and simplify the re-integration process...Do this as ANOTHER BRANCH instead
    of combining it with the write modifications, just in case we scrap it.
  
 Sorting the logic here....
 export to tmp-01
 echo problems to tmp-02
 use tmp-02 to inverse grep from tmp-01, and write to tmp-03
 tmp-03 is now our main data file
 now our "priority_params" are grepped from tmp-03 and directed to tmp-04
 tmp-04 is used to inverse grep from tmp-03 and directed to tmp-05
 
  Produces 1523 line output.
