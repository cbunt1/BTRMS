devnotes for transfersettings.sh

### Branch: Fix_Linux ### -- track in local repo, do not push or pull.

### SCOPE OF BRANCH: To fix (complete?) the functions and methods that work
	within the Linux environment, independent of the router itself.
	
	Primary goal: To be able to modify exisitng scripts "offline" so that if 
		one is so inclined, he can create one-off's from an existing good script
		without having to do the work in a router environment.
    
* Scenario: Running in *nix, should be able to modify an exisitng script, but
    export and modify w/no filename should fail cleanly. May want to consider
    checking the environment in the output script too--just to keep someone
    from doing something stupid.    
    
GenerateConfigScript() -- (482) Flag is used to modify ORIGVERSION output
    to the output file. Looks like intent is to feed a fixed $OSVer to
    the header of the output file rather than gathering it from the
    active nvram. I wonder if this shouldn't be variable controlled
    regardess of invocation method.
    
Note: The time & Date aren't used to modify anything except the filename in the
    "modify" routine. Therefore we should be able to easily modify the script
    to allow for modification of an exisitng script in a *nix environment.
    
Process the logic for a named file modification....
    Entry point: ./transfersettings modify filename
    set variables:  RouterName=current router name (differs between env)
                    OSVer=current OS version (differs between ver)
                    ExtEnv=1 (if outside a router)
                    WorkDir="./RouterName" (if writable, else /tmp/RouterName)
                    TmpDir=WorkDir/temp
                    Rundate=2015-12-02-1853
                    OutputFile="$WorkDir"/"$RunDate"_"$RouterName"_"$OSVer.sh"
                    CmdLnOpt=$1 (First parameter passed, modify or export)
                    ModFileSource=$2 (filename -- 2nd parameter passed)
                    ModFileDest="$WorkDir"/"$RunDate"_"$RouterName"_"$OSVer-mod.sh"
            Call Functions:
                CreateWorkDir -- no relevant changes
                if nonzero $2 (filename passed)
                go to parametermod
                    --therefore, either test for presence of file in the case,
                    or in the first part of ParameterMod
