**Introduction**

Buntster's Tomato Router Management System (BTRMS) is an automated tool for the backup and restoration of Shibby Tomato router
configurations. The BTRMS backup methodology differs from the onboard backup tool in that it builds an executable shell script 
file that restores system parameters line-by-line, rather than taking a snapshot "image" of the router's firmware. Doing so makes
possible the removal of certain hardware-specific parameters (or any chosen parameters) from the configuration, allowing the
successful restoration or migration of a configuration, even to a physically different router.

The tool has an option to allow certain modifications to an already-exisitng configuration, saving the changes to a separate script.
This allows for the building of a generalized "base" configuration, and then "patching" site or endpoint-specific parameters for the
target device. This is useful for multi-unit and/or multi-site rollouts where most of the core configurations are the same, parameters
such as hostnames, subnets, DHCP ranges, domain names, etc. differ.

The final script generated by the BTRMS is self-contianed and robust. It will completely clear the target router's nvram, and perform
a two-stage, line-by-line restoration of all parameters, pausing to ensure the NVRAM environment "catches up" before committing, and
finally terminates in a reboot. The process takes about two minutes start to finish, and requires only shell access to the target
device. It has even been used successfully to modify off-site equipment.
